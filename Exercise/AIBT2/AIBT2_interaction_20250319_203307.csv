However, I can provide you with some general guidelines to consider. Mobile-device policies typically aim to ensure security, privacy, and compliance with regulations.

Factors influencing the answer could include:

1. Device compatibility: Is the Nokia 2017 compatible with the university's systems and devices?
2. Supported operating system: Is the Nokia 2017's operating system (OS) compatible and supported by the university?
3. Security measures: Can you ensure the Nokia 2017 has up-to-date security software, antivirus protection, and encryption for sensitive data?
4. Data handling: Are you allowed to store or transfer sensitive university data on your personal device?
5. Connectivity: Is connecting your personal device to university devices and networks allowed?

Since I cannot determine the specifics of your university's mobile-device policy, I cannot provide a definitive yes or no answer. I strongly recommend reviewing your university's mobile-device policy carefully or contacting the IT department for clarification. They can provide you with the most accurate information based on your university's unique guidelines.",No
